Hi there. :wave:

You've reached the home page of Vecma, a group of students and researchers who
are interested in studying Linear Algebra and Computer Graphics.

Currently, the group consists of only one member: its founder
[Nguyen Hoang Duong][you-create]. Duong is an avid learner of linear algebra and
an aspiring computer graphics researcher. He hopes that one day, Vecma will
become a foundation taking the lead in the study, research, teaching, and
application of the mentioned subjects.

We'd like to show you some of the projects we've begun. All of them are still
heavy work in progress.

## Projects

All of our projects are open to everyone. We host our projects on
[our GitHub][github].

### Linear Algebra Education

At Vecma, **Linear Algebra Education** aims to equip everyone learning the
subject with the best materials. These materials can be articles, books, code,
videos, etc. First off in the near future, Vecma founder Duong would like to
make these resources available online, so that anyone can access them easily.

The project has its root in [**lnagb.js**](https://vecma-org.github.io/lnagb.js/),
a project that aims to develop a prolific linear algebra library in JavaScript.
While coding for the library, Duong thought of writing about linear algebra
alongside with lnagb.js how-to. He then decided to start 2 separated projects
&mdash; [**ilearn**](https://github.com/vecma-org/ilearn) and
[**ilin**](https://github.com/vecma-org/ilin) &mdash; to focus on producing
linear algebra basic-to-advance articles and containing references,
respectively.

Vecma also provides links to existing linear algebra contents in
[**Awesome Linear Algebra**](https://vecma-org.github.io/awesome-linear-algebra/).

### Website

Currently, Vecma operates, for the most parts, online. This is why the
development of our website is very crucial. Unfortunately, due to Duong's
limited free time as a schoolboy, he has not been able to work extensively on
this.

If you are confident with your web development and web design skills, you can
help us out!

### Organization

There are a lot to do before Vecma officially becomes a foundation. Registering
trademarks, admitting more members, establishing a real identity, calculating
finances, etc. are just a few among a lot to do. This needs time.

### Archived projects

Archived projects are projects we no longer maintain or projects that have been
paused. Archived projects can be unarchived at anytime if decided by us, and
they can be viewed and forked by anyone. Here's a list of our archived projects:

- [**pylnagb**](https://github.com/vecma-org/pylnagb) - A linear algebra library
  written in Python 3.

## Contact

If you are interested in our projects, want to join Vecma, or want to talk about
linear algebra or computer graphics, we'd love to hear from you. :heart:

Currently, the only way to contact us is probably by sending an letter to
<you_create@protonmail.com>. If you have questions or suggestions for a
particular project, you can open an issue on GitHub in the related repository
(this requires you to have a GitHub account).
